Trivia Type Game to be Written with JS Logic-jQuery HTML passes

J-Query / Bootstrap / CSS / HTML / Javascript

This project is an attempt to create a timed trivia "game" that:

1. Generates a question form.

2. Allows the user to select their reponses.

3. Tabulates the answers as correct, wrong or no response and feeds the results back to the user.

The purpose of the project is to practice implementation of Javascript Logic/jQuery to create a functional timed trivia form.

The timer and "game" starts as soon as it is loaded in the browser.
